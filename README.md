# Intro to C Programming Labs

This repository contains a collection of foundational C programming labs from a computer systems course. Each lab focuses on core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, strings, and structs.

These labs were completed as part of an introductory computer systems course. They reflect practice in low-level logic, memory representation, and structured data manipulation using C.

While each program is small and concise, they collectively demonstrate a solid understanding of C fundamentals and systems-level logic.



## Lab Overview

### lab1-intro-to-conditionals
Basic C programs using arithmetic and conditional logic. Includes:
- Tax calculation
- Triangle validation
- Volume of a cylinder
- Max temperature tracking

### lab2-functions-and-iteration
Introduces functions and for-loops. Focused on:
- Modular volume calculation
- Reusable triangle check
- Tracking max over 10 days

### lab3-arrays-loops-and-randomness
Array-based operations and loop logic. Features:
- Sum and average of random numbers
- Finding max in an array
- Loop-based total calculation

### lab4-pointers-and-parameter-passing
Covers pointer manipulation and pass-by-reference. Includes:
- Change-making with pointer parameters
- Pointer-based array sorting

### lab5-strings-and-dynamic-memory
Explores string operations and dynamic memory allocation. Covers:
- Concatenation using `malloc`
- Case conversion and string comparison
- Character counting in strings

### lab6-structs-and-bitwise-operations
Combines struct usage, simple data storage, and bitwise logic:
- Mini customer database using structs
- Bitwise AND/OR/XOR with binary + hex output
- Volume comparison between boxes using structs
